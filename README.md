# TFIDF Text Classification

The purpose of this project is to calculate the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF) value to perform text classifcation on an SMS dataset and Movie Review dataset. 

The resulting model can predict if new texts should be classified as Ham or Spam for the first dataset and if a movie review is positive or negative for the second dataset. 

An updated dataset for the movie reviews can be found here:
